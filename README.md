## Description

Movie Night Mania allows the user to find a random movie based on the streaming platforms they have and the genres they enjoy. Once the recommended movie shows on their screen, the user can add it to their saved movies list or try their luck with another movie. 

The recommended movie is diplayed with the following:

- Title and Year of Release
- Main Cast
- Synopsis
- IBDb Rating with Link to the IMDb Page

When a movie is recommended to the user, the application also displays a list of similar movies to the one recommended. 

Users can see their saved movies any time by clicking the "My List" button on the navigation bar. The saved movies page will show the user's eight most recent saved movies, which can be removed at any point by clicking the "Remove" button. 

This application will allow casual movie watchers to be introduced to movies they may not have otherwise watched.
